Approximately half of the lessons will be dedicated to lectures, introducing the primary methods used in computational astrophysics and their significant applications. The other half of the course will consist of laboratory sessions. During these sessions, students, divided into groups of 3-4 members, will put into practice what's illustrated in the lectures by developing an N-body code under the guidance of the lecturer and tackling specific numerical problems of astrophysics. Both the code creation and the completion of the numerical exercises are prerequisites for accessing the final exam.Towards the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to discuss with the lecturer the choice of a final astrophysical project. This project can be executed using the code they developed or, alternatively, one of the advanced codes presented during the lessons.To encourage more active participation from students, ""live feedback"" tools such as Wooclap or Mentimeter will be used. Moodle tools will also be utilized to provide an open and always available discussion space among students and with the lecturer.SPECIAL:This course is part of a pilot initiative within the European FEEF project (https://feef.unl.pt), which the University of Padua joins through the Career Service Office. The goal of the FEEF project is to develop and strengthen cross-cutting skills in students, often required in the entrepreneurial context, thus bridging the academic world with the professional realm. As part of this initiative, one of the lessons will feature a representative from an aerospace industry company, who will present a typical challenge of their field to the students. Students will have the opportunity to tackle this problem using the skills they've gained in this course and in previous training paths. The lecturer will support students in this endeavour, introducing analytical techniques and problem-solving according to the FEEF guidelines. Although the project in question will not be part of the exam material, it represents a valuable chance for students to directly interface with the corporate world and understand how the tools and skills learned can be applied beyond the astrophysical field.","* Lecture material by Giuliano Iorio* Gravitational N-Body Simulations: Tools and Algorithms, Sverre J.

These techniques are particularly useful for problems for which it is impossible or very difficult to reach a mathematical formalization usable for the definition of an ad-hoc algorithmic solution. Examples of these problems are perceptual tasks, such as visual recognition of handwritten digits, or problems in which data is corrupted by noise or is incomplete.

The text also includes questions in which the student is required to show understanding of the applicative issues taught in the computer lab. These questions are designed to assess whether the student has developed the ability to apply the concepts learned during the course. If the assessment of the written exam is not satisfactory for the student, the teacher may supplement the written examination with an oral examination for a better assessment of the level of learning of the student.","The course will cover the topics listed below - Introduction: When to apply Machine Learning techniques; Machine Learning Paradigms; Basic ingredients of Machine Learning. - Learning Concepts: The complexity of the Hypothesis Space; Complexity Measures; Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms; - Decision Trees: Learning Decision Trees; Treatment of Numerical Data, Missing Data, Costs; Pruning Techniques and Derivation of Decision Rules. - Probabilistic Learning: Bayesian Learning; Examples of Application to Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (clustering); Optimal Bayes classifier; EM. - Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines: Introduction to Neural Networks; Classification Margin, Support Vector Machines for Classification and Regression, Kernel Functions. - Application Issues: Classification Pipeline, Data Representation, and Selection of Variables; Model Selection; Clustering; Ensemble Learning; Recommender Systems.","The course consists of lectures and exercises in the computer lab.

This allows obtaining better service levels and higher efficiency. The formal modelling of these processes is used as input for information systems (e.g., SAP or ERP systems) that automatically self-configure to comply and function in accordance with these process models.This course aims to introduce and study concepts, methods, and techniques to model, analyze and improve business processes. More efficient business processes lead to more efficient information systems, which, in turn, allow organizations to provide better services and higher-quality goods. The course can conceptually be broken down in three parts:1) In the first part, the course will introduce the principle and languages to model business processes.2) In the second part, the largest, the course will introduce techniques for the analysis of business processes. These techniques are based on Process Mining. Process Mining aims to leverage on transactional data of the organizations (a.k.a. event logs) to analyze and improve business processes. Process Mining uses the information in the event logs to discover how processes are REALLY executed, unveiling the violations of protocols and regulations, the inefficiencies, and every criticality that can endanger the executions of the processes themselves. While traditional Business Intelligence techniques are based on interviews and questionnaires with process' actors, Process Mining is integral part of Data Science: the subjective of the process actors is replaced by the objectivity of the conclusions drawn from the actual process' data. 3) The ultimate goal of Process Mining is to put forward concrete actions that can improve the processes, both from the viewpoint of the adherence to the current norms and from an efficiency viewpoint.In the third part of the process, the insights obtained via process Mining are used to build simulation models of the business processes that are ""digital twins"" of the real processes. These ""digital twins"" mirror the behaviour of the real processes, in every aspect (temporal characteristics and constraints, decisions, manipulated data, resources, etc.). Simulation models (the digital twins) show the advantage that it is possible to simulate variants of these processes and measure the impact on the process' performances, without actually changing the real processes, thus reducing the costs and risks to execute alternative processes that might be more expensive and less efficient than the original ones.",Written Exam and Project,"The project work and the written exam will be evaluated on the following criteria: i) student’s knowledge of the concepts, methods, and technologies; ii) ability of the student to master the implementation technology; iii) student’s capacity for synthesis, precision, clarity, and abstraction, as demonstrated by the written exam and project presentation. The final grade is achieved as the weighted sum of the grades of the written exam (60%) and the project (40%).","The course will cover the topics listed below:1. MODELING VIA PETRI NETS- Basic concepts of Petri nets- Usage of Petri Nets to model business processes- Structural analysis of Petri Nets- Soundness of business process models: Principles and Verification- Usage of Woped as software tool to model and check the soundness of process models.2. PROCESS MINING- Introduction to Process Mining and Event Logs- Basic Techniques for Process Discovery and Limitations- Advanced Techniques for Process Discovery: Heuristic Miner and Region Miner- Conformance checking based on token replay- Conformance checking based on alignments- Mining the Additional Perspectives on Decision, Time and Resource- Social Network Analysis- Usage of open-source and commercial software tools for the analysis of business processes through Process Mining.3. BUSINESS PROCESS SIMULATION- Principle and Methodologies for simulation: definitions of warm-up and cool-down intervals, management of the simulation stochasticity via multiple, independent runs, analysis of the outcome- Definitions of the elements of a scenario of business process simulation: arrival rate, branching probabilities, resource pools, activity-duration probability distributions- Usage of BPMN for the specification of business process simulation models- Use of Process Mining to mine business process simulation models- Methodologies for the definition of ""What-if"" scenarios- Usage of BIMP as software tool to simulate business processes.","The course is run through the alternation of theoretical lectures, tutorial, laboratory sessions, and seminars.The laboratory sessions will give the opportunity to ""make the hands dirty"" and will be largely based on real-life data set to better comprehend the complexity to carry out a Process-mining project and work with real-process data.","Three books will be used for three parts of the course, as indicated in the box ""Text books"" below.These are complemented by (1) an execise bundle, and (2) hands-on documents for the laboratory sessions.

All assignments include a component of bibliographic study of the topic background and state of the art, and practical experiments about aspects of the problem at hand.","The execution of the assignment involves frequent and intense dialogue with the instructor. The study involved in that effort allows the student to acquire increasing familiarity with the principal challenges posed by the design and implementation of a distributed concurrent and parallel system. Producing a technical report to accompany the project work stimulates the student’s capacity for synthesis, vision, and abstraction. The student’s presentation of the project work and of the accompanying report allows the instructor to complete the assessment of the student’s understanding of the main themes of the class, including the student’s mastering of the related implementation technology.","Concurrency- Introduction: how concurrency came about and how to understand it- Processes, communication, and synchronization- A concrete model of concurrency and some desirable extensions- The timing dimension- Virtualization (brief)Distribution- Introduction: definitions and fundamental challenges- Communication, synchronization, and concurrency in a distributed system- The naming system and the notion of statelessness- Example technologies: Java RMI; Ada DSA, CORBAThe frontier of Cloud Computing- Origin and motivation- The distinguishing traits of cloud-native applications- The dimensions of scalability.","The class includes two main segments, and a third and final stretch. - The first segment focuses on concurrency with special emphasis on the construction of models of concurrency directly supported by such programming languages as Java and Ada, with exploration of other emerging language paradigms.- The second segment addresses distribution, reviewing the progress in the state of the art from socket-based systems to modern middleware, via CORBA (as a historical testimony, now technically obsolete), up to and including traditional client-server heterogeneous systems.- The third and final stretch concludes the class trajectory by looking at recent, advanced paradigms such as virtualization and cloud computing. The analysis of each such subject is complemented by the discussion of practical examples, first illustrated in the class by the instructor and subsequently developed by the students in full autonomy.The learning method applied in the class includes:1) class lectures, both synchronous (in presence) and asynchronous (by online resources);2) flipped-classroom activities centered on selected topics that help prepare the students' awareness of certain software engineering tools and their practices of use; 3) exercises for theory, with immediate feedback from the instructor;4) practical activities, with progressive feedback from the instructor.","The lecture material presented in class is made available by two complementary means: in the Moodle platform, after authenticated access, for the online resources; in a static web page dedicated to the class, organized by the lecture schedule, for all of the additional learning material destined to the public domain.","Alan Burns and Andy Wellings, Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada. --: Cambridge University Press, 2007.        https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/concurrent-and-real-time-programming-in-ada/9DA4389E52005382D4CC1FC5D812DA71#

(cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation )- Dataflow program analysis: This is a technique for gathering information about the possible set of values calculated at various program points. A program's control flow graph is used to determine those parts of a program to which a particular value assigned to a variable might propagate. The information gathered is often used by compilers (such as gcc and javac) when optimizing a program.

The course will first revise some basic concepts of machine learning. Then, we introduce a framework to assess the security properties of learning agents and present the taxonomy of attacks against learners, in a game-theoretic framework with two players, the attacker and the defender. Then, three types of attacks will be analysed: causative, exploratory, and evasion attacks. Causative attacks attempt to provide incorrect and misrepresentative training data to the algorithm, such that it does not learn the intended function. Exploratory attacks occur after the algorithm has been trained, and attempt to uncover information about its inner workings, in order to identify weaknesses of the algorithm. Evasion attacks are also launched upon trained algorithms, and involve providing the algorithm with input (test) data that will result in an incorrect output. Several case studies of attacks and defense strategies will be presented during the course, including attacks against Spam detection filters, PCA detector of traffic anomalies, the AOL data leak, and the Netflix prize attack.Outline- Basic concepts of machine learning- Framework of secure learning* exploratory attacks* causative attacks* evasion attacks- Attacking a hypersphere learner* causative attacks on hypersphere detectors* optimal unconstrained attacks* constrained attacks- Availability Attack Case Study: SpamBayes* Causative attacks* Reject on Negative Impact (RONI) defense- Integrity Attack Case Study: PCA Detector* Corruption-Resilient Detectors- Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms for SVM Learning* Defense strategies based on differential privacy* Bounds on Optimal Differential Privacy- Near-Optimal Evasion of Classifiers* Adversarial Cost* Evasion techniques",The course will include both lectures and laboratories using python language.,The slides of the lessons will be made available through the https://stem.elearning.unipd.it/ platform and a reference to the textbook of the presented material will be also provided.,"Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy; Kantarcioglu, Murat; Vorobeychik,Yevgeniy, Adversarial machine learning.

This allows obtaining better service levels and higher efficiency. The formal modelling of these processes is used as input for information systems (e.g., SAP or ERP systems) that automatically self-configure to comply and function in accordance with these process models.This course aims to introduce and study concepts, methods, and techniques to model, analyze and improve business processes. More efficient business processes lead to more efficient information systems, which, in turn, allow organizations to provide better services and higher-quality goods. The course can conceptually be broken down in three parts:1) In the first part, the course will introduce the principle and languages to model business processes.2) In the second part, the largest, the course will introduce techniques for the analysis of business processes. These techniques are based on Process Mining. Process Mining aims to leverage on transactional data of the organizations (a.k.a. event logs) to analyze and improve business processes. Process Mining uses the information in the event logs to discover how processes are REALLY executed, unveiling the violations of protocols and regulations, the inefficiencies, and every criticality that can endanger the executions of the processes themselves. While traditional Business Intelligence techniques are based on interviews and questionnaires with process' actors, Process Mining is integral part of Data Science: the subjective of the process actors is replaced by the objectivity of the conclusions drawn from the actual process' data. 3) The ultimate goal of Process Mining is to put forward concrete actions that can improve the processes, both from the viewpoint of the adherence to the current norms and from an efficiency viewpoint.In the third part of the process, the insights obtained via process Mining are used to build simulation models of the business processes that are ""digital twins"" of the real processes. These ""digital twins"" mirror the behaviour of the real processes, in every aspect (temporal characteristics and constraints, decisions, manipulated data, resources, etc.). Simulation models (the digital twins) show the advantage that it is possible to simulate variants of these processes and measure the impact on the process' performances, without actually changing the real processes, thus reducing the costs and risks to execute alternative processes that might be more expensive and less efficient than the original ones.",Written Exam and Project,"The project work and the written exam will be evaluated on the following criteria: i) student’s knowledge of the concepts, methods, and technologies; ii) ability of the student to master the implementation technology; iii) student’s capacity for synthesis, precision, clarity, and abstraction, as demonstrated by the written exam and project presentation. The final grade is achieved as the weighted sum of the grades of the written exam (60%) and the project (40%).","The course will cover the topics listed below:1. MODELING VIA PETRI NETS- Basic concepts of Petri nets- Usage of Petri Nets to model business processes- Structural analysis of Petri Nets- Soundness of business process models: Principles and Verification- Usage of Woped as software tool to model and check the soundness of process models.2. PROCESS MINING- Introduction to Process Mining and Event Logs- Basic Techniques for Process Discovery and Limitations- Advanced Techniques for Process Discovery: Heuristic Miner and Region Miner- Conformance checking based on token replay- Conformance checking based on alignments- Mining the Additional Perspectives on Decision, Time and Resource- Social Network Analysis- Usage of open-source and commercial software tools for the analysis of business processes through Process Mining.3. BUSINESS PROCESS SIMULATION- Principle and Methodologies for simulation: definitions of warm-up and cool-down intervals, management of the simulation stochasticity via multiple, independent runs, analysis of the outcome- Definitions of the elements of a scenario of business process simulation: arrival rate, branching probabilities, resource pools, activity-duration probability distributions- Usage of BPMN for the specification of business process simulation models- Use of Process Mining to mine business process simulation models- Methodologies for the definition of ""What-if"" scenarios- Usage of BIMP as software tool to simulate business processes.","The course is run through the alternation of theoretical lectures, tutorial, laboratory sessions, and seminars.The laboratory sessions will give the opportunity to ""make the hands dirty"" and will be largely based on real-life data set to better comprehend the complexity to carry out a Process-mining project and work with real-process data.","Three books will be used for three parts of the course, as indicated in the box ""Text books"" below.These are complemented by (1) an execise bundle, and (2) hands-on documents for the laboratory sessions.

This aim is pursued both at the intraspecific than at the species/higher taxa level.Phylogeography is a recent discipline which studies the factors and processes shaping the spatial distribution of the genetic variation within species through the reconstruction of gene and population genealogies, tipically using genetic markers. Phylogeography attempts to link genetic diversity and lineage differentiation to past events such as population expansions, bottleneck events, migration and vicariance.The knowledges that the student will obtain in the part of the course on phylogeography are:1) knowledge of methods used in phylogeography, relatively to the specific methods used, the kind of data that can be obtained and on data analysis;2) knowledge of which questions can be addressed with the phylogeographic approach.The skills that the student will develop are:1) capacity to read a phygeography scientific paper and to understand the methods used;2) capacity to autonomously judge the robustness of methods used and the soundness of conclusions drawnin a phylogeographic article.Biogeography studies the geographical distribution of organisms, mainly at the level of species or higher rank taxa. This distribution can generally be explained by a combination of historical factors, such as speciation, extinction, continental drift and ice ages, with the current environmental conditions. In this sense, the main distinction between	 Phylogeography and Biogeography is the time scale of the relevant processes, within and between species. The main educational goal of the part of Biogeography is to introduce the student to the study of the distribution of organisms on land, in the seas and freshwaters, as well as to the causes that led to such distributions in different environments.  The knowledges that the student will obtain in the part of the course on Biogeography are:1) basic knowledge of biogeography with its multidisciplinary connections2) main approaches to the description of biogeographic patterns3) main synchronic and diachronic paradigms which explain the latterThe skills that the student will develop are:1) to evaluate pros and cons of a descriptive framework within a multidisciplinary field of studies2) to critically approach hypothesis formulation and testing in biogeography context","Written exam for Phylogeography (8 to ten multiple choice questions on the course topics and one open question with extended answer on one of the scientific articles of the course, to evaluate the student skills on synthesis, learning autonomy, use of lexicon). Oral exam for Biogeography.","The overall assessment will be based on the ascertainment of the knowledges acquired in Biogeography and Phylogeography, with particular attention to the critical elaboration of concepts presented during classes. The two parts of the exam will be evaluted separately (on a 30th scale) and the final grade will be determined as the average of the two grades, weighted on the relative credits.","The course is held by two teachers, one for Biogeography (3 credits of teaching in class and 1 credit of exercitation) and the other for Phylogeography (3 credits of teaching in class), and it is structured as detailed below.BIOGEOGRAPHY Introduction to the discipline – Descriptive biogeography: ranges, biogeographic regions, chorology – Ecobiogeography: biotic and abiotic factors – Historical biogeography: dispersal, vicariance, evolution – History of the Italian fauna (3 credits). Exercitation (1 credit) consists in field work of biological monitoring, whose logistic is defined from year to year.PHYLOGEOGRAPHYHistorical introduction to the discipline (1 credit).Mitochondrial DNA: data analysis; study of population differentiation in relation to paleoclimatic events; historical demography; ancient DNA (1 credit).Nuclear DNA: data analysis; individual identification; identification of populations on a genetic base; admixture; genetic variability and bottlenecks (1 credit).","The course comprise classes, including critical reading of literature, and practical work in the field for Biogeography.","Slides made available by the teachers and textbooks, mainly for reference.","Avise JC, Molecular Markers, Natural History, and Evolution, Second Edition.

Obtaining insight and knowledge into concepts, methods, techniques and applications in a broader context of geological studies.2nd Module: Past ClimatesAt first, students will learn the conceptual bases of the processes and dynamics that control the modern Climate System of the Earth, with particular emphasis on the ocean and atmosphere realms. Secondly, they will become familiar with the principal investigation tools and methods for achieving paleoclimatic information from geological and historical records. Lastly, once acquainted with the most acknowledged theories as to why Earth climates are called to cope with periodic changes, students will be involved in a virtual journey through the geological past of our planet in pursue of the natural and historical evidences of long- and short-term variations in Earth climates.In general, students will acquire and improve new skills and competences, among which:1) integrating basic concepts with pristine know-how and experiences;2) improving their own personal ability to criticize, analyze and synthesize the information collected from sources of different reliability and scope (from mass media to scientific publications);3) a better capacity to communicate and disseminate their knowledge.","1st Module: Past lifeThe knownledge/skills acquired during the course is/are checked by means of a written examination during which the concepts, the scientific terminology, the syntesis ability and the critical spririt will be evaluated.2nd Module: Past ClimatesStudent's grades will be ascertained by means of an oral, open-question exam, in order to gauge the ability of the candidate to engender connections between different subjects and to establish critical and original approaches to the matter in question.","1st Module: Past LifeThe criteria that will be used to evaluate the knowledge and the skills acquired during the course are as follows: 1) knownledge of the topics covered in the course; 2) understanding of the topics covered in the class; 3) criticism and link capability on the knowledge acquired during the course; 4) synthesis ability; 5) proper terminology.2nd Module: Past Climates:Students will be evaluated based on their knowledge of the subjects discussed during class, however of special importance will be their skill to prove independent and critical thinking capabilities. Therefore, of primary relevance will be the candidate ability to establish independent linkages between dissimilar topics, as well as his skill in providing explanations  with a rigorous and appropriate, yet original, language. Self-managed integrations to the Course program, such as topic consolidation, reading of scientific papers and attendance to meetings focused on the matter, will also be appreciated and evaluated accordingly.","1st Module: Past life One of the basic paradigms of geology is that the present is the key to the past. In recent years, however, and especially considering the increasingly important role played by humans in changing our Planet, scientists are turning that basic tenet around to the past is the key to the future. A proxy-based approach is fundamental to reconstruct past conditions. Proxies are physical, chemical and biological materials preserved in the geologic record allowing for the estimation of climatic or environmental parameters. Proxy-based reconstructions span all timescales, from year-to-year variations to those that occurred over millions of years and provide a tool in order to better understand how climate and environments has varied trough time both before and after human-related alteration of the Earth. In this context this course will focus on: 1) Main geological archives (sediments, corals, trees, ice cores, speleothems, instrumental datasets). Completeness, Resolution and time frame.2) Main proxies in terms of their rationale, calibration (direct, indirect) and possible applications with the final aim to reconstruct past environments and climates. Proxies considered are: • Biotic: Terrestrial (pollen and spores; plant macrofossils) and aquatic (foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, ostracodes, diatoms, radiolarians and silicoflagellates, corals, dinoflagellates cysts, mollusks; • Chemical: composition of shells; biomarkers, elemental analysis;• Physical: Sediment Composition. Types of minerals and fossils;The information acquired will be applied by means of a discussion of a case study and would serve to emphasize the potential of the fossil record in reconstructing the past (e.g., modern analogues) as well as interpreting changes observed in perturbated present day environments.2nd Module: Past ClimatesCompelling evidence indicates that, since the early days of its Byr-long history, our planet had to cope unceasingly with changes in regional and global climates, which occurred on different time scales and amplitudes. However, predictive models proved to fall short when attempting precise forecasts of future climate trends, since the Earth climate system is complex, manifold and hardly predictable in its behavior. Crucial insights are provided by investigating the climate history in the Geologic past, which holds the key for understanding the future of our planet.The Course will be organized as follows:1 - Introduction to the Climate System (2.5 CFU).Climate: definitions and calculation of the Earth radiative balance. Elements of descriptive and dynamic Oceanography. The astronomical theory of climate. Stable oxygen isotopes for paleoclimate reconstructions.2 - Past climates of the Earth (3 CFU)The great Proterozoic and Paleozoic glaciations.

A major concern within metamorphic rocks is the interrelationship between deformation and mineral growth. Recognition of the relative timing between deformation and the evolution of metamorphicmineral assemblage can give key information for the reconstruction of “Presssure - Temperature - Deformation”(PTD) paths.

Are noted in good order, with indication of the date, of the experimental conditions and with all the comments.Social Target:learn to work in a group (not only because in many cases it is not possible to perform measurements or set up the experimental apparatus on their own, but also for the opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss, discuss)",The exam consists of a written and an oral part.The written part is the creation of an educational project on a topic of physics chosen by the student.The oral part is  the presentation to the teacher of the same educational project prepared in the written part,"The expression of a final judgment of competence will be classified according to three major specific areas: that related to the results obtained in the performance of a task or in the realization of the product (objective); that relating to the perception that the student has of his work (subjective); that related to how the student came to achieve these results (intersubjective).The three perspectives of analysis indicated require different instruments, to be integrated and composed in a multiple and articulated evaluation design.

Intersubjective dimension: observation protocols, comments, interactions between equals","Several thematic nuclei of physics will be addressed, for example:• Study of the motion of a body on a rectilinear guide: online acquisition of distance by sonar, temporal graphs of distance, speed and acceleration, study of friction, measurement of gravity acceleration. Error analysis.• Geometric optics: laws of reflection and refraction. The properties of the lenses are applied in the construction of a telescope• Experiments with waves: generation and propagation of waves in a liquid. Wavelength measurement. Reflection and refraction of plane waves. Interference and diffraction phenomena.• Analysis of the wave characteristics of light with diffraction and interference experiments with laser light. Analysis of data and comparisons with the theoretical model.• Conservation and transformation of energy. Study and analysis of thermal phenomena. Experiments related to the first law of thermodynamics. State changes.• Electrical and magnetic phenomena. Magnetic field generated by an electric current. Electromagnetic induction study.• Didactic methodologies and didactic planning.","Frontal lessons• Demonstration experiments• Experiments to study / verify a physical law.These are the experiments that are typically done in an equipped laboratory. Physical law is generally already known. However, they can also be done as an introduction or preparation to the law. They have prevalent didactic values ​​for the measurement, data analysis, a posteriori formalization and for training aspects in general.• Demonstration experiments.They are used to attract attention and stimulate reflection on a particular phenomenology, before starting the detailed discussion on the topic.• Discovery experiments.They are experiments that have the characteristic of stimulating interest and curiosity and therefore of dragging to find explanations, thus clarifying, generally at a qualitative level only, the physical concepts involved• Experiments with objects or phenomena of everyday life.They start from the knowledge and memory of familiar and well-known things, or which you think you know well, and that you are used to describing with everyday language. They help develop ""critical thinking"" and the transition from everyday to scientific language.• Use of the computer in the physics laboratory.Simulations: construction of various types of simulations to observe otherwise inaccessible phenomena (too expensive, in fact impossible or dangerous). The computer can then be used both for data analysis and for the online collection of data from an experiment, using appropriate sensors and interfaces for connecting to the computer. They are particularly useful for collecting data that changes very quickly or very slowly over time",Not mentioned.,"--, Homework and test questions for introductory physics teachingArnold B. Arons.

Fundamental contributions by Levi-Civita and its impact on Einstein's theory of general relativity will be analyzed.2) Analysis of some aspects of number theory connected with the historical development of Fermat's Last Theorem. After an introduction to diophantine equations, we will study Fermat's method of infinite descent, with which he solved a special case of the Last Theorem. We will subsequently introduce methods from algebraic number theory, as the ideal class group, which originated as tools to approach such problem, from Gauss on.If time permits, we will briefly survey the modern ideas on which is based the 1995 proof Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles. 3) Historical development of the concept of function, from Leibniz and Bernoulli up to Bourbaki, passing through the contributions of Euler, Fourier, Dirichlet and Weierstrass, also in relation with the so-called crisis of the foundations and the arithmetization of mathematical analysis.Important topics will be the debate between Euler and d'Alembert on the vibrating string, its epilogue by Sobolev, the birth of distributions and weak solutions.

This topic has little mention in traditional books on solid state physics since disordered materials are difficult to describe as they present no translational periodicity at the atomic level. The student will be exposed to the most important ideas required to describe the structural and dynamical properties of these materials, as well as to the working principles of the main experimental techniques used to characterize them. At the end of the course, the student will be able to recognize the properties of disordered materials required for tailored applications, as in the case of the famous Gorilla glasses used in our smartphones or in the case of the phase-change materials used as non-volatile memories to cope with the problems posed by the exponentially increasing amount of global data.

Then follow-up by two practicals linked with the technique and the problem. One of these with full assistance and another partly individual practice.Introductory session: Biological coding; Protein as an ML object; Protein as a simulation object The topic of the 6 problems varies each year so that the students work on “hot” scientific problems, providing opportunities to continue as an internship or PhD studies abroad. The topics considered:Conformational dynamics of proteins. Molecular dynamics, Enhanced sampling methods.  Force-field development. Machine learning force-field for MD, Coarse-grained simulationsProtein interactions. Small molecule binding.  Free energy calculations, clustering methods.Protein folding. Co-evolution analysis (MSA). AI structure predictions.Protein networks. Interaction networks, yeast versus human networks.Protein condensates.

As part of this initiative, one of the lessons will feature a representative from an aerospace industry company, who will present a typical challenge of their field to the students. Students will have the opportunity to tackle this problem using the skills they've gained in this course and in previous training paths. The lecturer will support students in this endeavour, introducing analytical techniques and problem-solving according to the FEEF guidelines.

It is also advisable to have basic knowledge of Programming and Artificial Intelligence. The course does not have prerequisites.,"The aim of the course is to introduce the student to the basic concepts that characterize Machine Learning, i.e. the class of techniques and algorithms that, starting from empirical data allow a computer system to acquire new knowledge, or to correct and/or to refine knowledge already available. These techniques are particularly useful for problems for which it is impossible or very difficult to reach a mathematical formalization usable for the definition of an ad-hoc algorithmic solution. Examples of these problems are perceptual tasks, such as visual recognition of handwritten digits, or problems in which data is corrupted by noise or is incomplete. The course mainly covers numerical methods. Students will face practical exercises in a computer lab that allow them to test the application of the acquired knowledge to small practical examples.","The student has to pass a written examination and if deemed necessary by the teacher, an oral examination. There is also a project that can be replaced by activities during the course.","The text of the written exam includes some questions that aim to assess the level of learning reached by the student concerning the concepts taught in the course and the student's ability to perform a critical analysis on them. The text also includes questions in which the student is required to show understanding of the applicative issues taught in the computer lab. These questions are designed to assess whether the student has developed the ability to apply the concepts learned during the course. If the assessment of the written exam is not satisfactory for the student, the teacher may supplement the written examination with an oral examination for a better assessment of the level of learning of the student.","The course will cover the topics listed below - Introduction: When to apply Machine Learning techniques; Machine Learning Paradigms; Basic ingredients of Machine Learning. - Learning Concepts: The complexity of the Hypothesis Space; Complexity Measures; Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms; - Decision Trees: Learning Decision Trees; Treatment of Numerical Data, Missing Data, Costs; Pruning Techniques and Derivation of Decision Rules. - Probabilistic Learning: Bayesian Learning; Examples of Application to Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (clustering); Optimal Bayes classifier; EM. - Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines: Introduction to Neural Networks; Classification Margin, Support Vector Machines for Classification and Regression, Kernel Functions. - Application Issues: Classification Pipeline, Data Representation, and Selection of Variables; Model Selection; Clustering; Ensemble Learning; Recommender Systems.","The course consists of lectures and exercises in the computer lab. The exercises in the computer lab allow the students to experiment, under various operating scenarios, with the techniques introduced in class. In this way, students can verify experimentally the concepts learned in class and acquire the ability to apply the learned concepts and to perform critical judgment.",Slides presented during the lectures are made ​​available to students as reference material.,"Mitchell, Tom M., Machine learning.

A willingness to get involved and consistency in participating in team work are essential to fully enjoy the benefits of the method.A basic knowledge of demography is required to take the course profitably. Students who have never taken any course in demography should study basic demographic concepts and measures on one of the following manuals: - Rowland D. T.

The RAT test measures theirc omprehension and mastery of the assigned readings.The same test is given first on individual basis and then to each team.Feedback and Mini-lecture - Following the RATs, the instructor provides a short clarifying lecture on any difficult or troublesome concepts or ask further questions of the class to help clarify the material and stimulate discussion between groupsPhase 3 - In-Class Activities (Team Application): Students in teams use the foundational knowledge, acquired in the first two phases to analyse demographic data and to make decisions that will be reported publically and subject to cross-team discussion/critique.","In addition to the study of reference texts, critical reading of some articles from the demographic literature on specific topics will be offered during the course.

Lectures will alternate (i) the presentation and critical appraisal of problems encountered in routine data analysis and (ii) student's independent/group work. The emphasis is on the discussion and analysis of real life applications.  These are used to illustrate the concepts and motivate the application of the statistical toolbox acquired by the students in previous courses for the purpose of developing their operational capabilities.  As to this, the course features two moments.  It starts with the course instructors presenting the practical problems and data sets together with the most suitable analysis techniques.  Later on, the students will be asked to tackle independently a number of real life applications proposed by the instructors and to analyze the assigned data sets using the statistical techniques they consider to fit the best.NB: This course is characterized by a strong interaction between students and course instructors.  Students will hence be asked to sign up beforehand (the details will be announced in December 2019); admission may be limited.

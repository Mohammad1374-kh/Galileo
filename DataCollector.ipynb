      "The master degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology aims at providing students with a comprehensive, up-to-date view of the main fields of modern astrophysics, including astronomical detectors and techniques, black holes and neutron stars, cosmology, gravitational physics, planets, stars and galaxies. Particular emphasis is placed on a solid background in physics and on the growing ties among astrophysics and different branches of physics (theoretical and experimental particle physics, detector physics, nuclear physics) in the coming era of multi-messenger observations.\n",
      "Master graduates in Astrophysics and Cosmology will gain a detailed working knowledge of astrophysics both on the theoretical and observational sides. The final thesis (42 ECTS, approximately six months full time) will put the student in direct contact with an advanced research topic, enhancing his/her ability to carry out autonomous work. This will be key for either a successful continuation to a PhD in Astrophysics or in Physics, or to a job in the industrial or service sectors based on novel technologies.\n",

      "- employment in sectors that require skills in modelling, testing, and interpreting large and complex data sets, such as consulting companies, research centers and public administration;\n",
      "- high-level teaching and/or dissemination of scientific culture, with particular reference to various theoretical, experimental and applicative aspects of classical and modern physics, astrophysics and cosmology.
